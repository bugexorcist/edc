When your teeth are in correct alignment, they prevent each other from moving. If you are missing a tooth or teeth, this allows adjacent and opposing teeth to move and impinge into the vacant space, your teeth can become crooked and therefore hard to clean and this can lead to decay and inevitably tooth loss. Also when a tooth root is absent, your jawbone will deteriorate as it is no longer being used to secure your tooth, and this may result in changes of facial muscle structure.
Conducted under local anaesthetic a titanium screw structure is placed under the gum-line to replace a missing tooth root. Most patients report little if any discomfort and may resume their normal day-to-day activities the following day. After your dental implant has fused with your jawbone (usually it takes 3-6 months) it is uncovered and a connector (called an abutment) is attached. It is to this abutment that your replacement crown or bridge is secured.
Also several implants can be used for the stabilisation of loose and uncomfortable dentures.
Oral hygiene is just as important for your new dental implant as it is for your natural teeth. Your surrounding teeth and gums are still prone to the effects of gum disease. 

Whenever possible all aspects of implant placement will be carried out at The Smile Lounge, although some cases may require referring to an dental implant specialist.
Most people are suitable candidates for a dental implant. However, there may be some exceptions, we will discuss this with you at your consultation.
Please call the surgery on 6247 5100 to make an appointment.

";i:1;s:1192:"Orthodontics is the branch of dentistry which specialises in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of problems in the alignment of teeth and jaws.
Orthodontic treatment involves the design and use of corrective appliances including braces, plates, headgears and functional appliances (twin blocks, expanders) to align your jaws.

During your first visit we will examine your mouth, jaw and teeth thoroughly, which will enable us to advise you on the treatment options available. We can then discuss with you your personalised treatment plan, well as costing.
We often use fixed appliances, also called braces to correct malocclusions such as under bites, over bites, cross bites, open bites, or crooked teeth, whether cosmetic or structural. Orthodontic braces, including stainless steel, cosmetic braces and Invisalign, are often used in conjunction with other appliances to widen your jaws and palate and to create spaces between teeth.
Most orthodontic patients are children or teenagers; however, we are seeing more and more adults for orthodontic treatment.  
For invisable braces please refer to our Invisalign page.
